# Commendation

## Description

This script runs on the [Dossier](https://politicsandwar.com/nation/dossier/) Page, and can locate nations you haven't commended yet for you to commend. This script requires full internet access to ping the server's v3 API to get the nations data. A Run button will appear on the page for you to execute this script. Once it's running, to stop it, refresh, close, or redirect the [Dossier](https://politicsandwar.com/nation/dossier/) to another page. You'll also need to allow popups for this script to work properly.
