# Reward-Ads

## Description

This script runs on the [Rewarded Ads](https://politicsandwar.com/rewarded-ads/) page and clicks the button so you don't have to. When you reach the maximum of 25 ads, it forwards you to your Nation page. It will work in it's own tab, but a window is suggested as the browser seems to pause or slow down JavaScript when inactive.

### Aggressive Mode

At the bottom of the left sidebar you'll find a checkbox to toggle AggressiveMode on and off. If on, the script will keep it's own timer and force the button to reappear when it says 3 mins is up. If left off, it will just wait for the game to make the button reappear. The game's timer can count slow at times making what should only take a max of an hour and 15 mins much longer.
