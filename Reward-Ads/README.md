# Reward-Ads

## Description

This script runs on the [Rewarded Ads](https://politicsandwar.com/rewarded-ads/) page and clicks the button so you don't have to. When you reach the maximum of 25 ads, it forwards you to your Nation page.

**Aggressive Mode**

At the bottom of the left sidebar you'll find a checkbox that lets you toggle on/off aggressive mode. By default this checkbox is not ticked. Aggressive mode will, instead of waiting for the button to reappear, set its own 3 minute timer and refresh the page to then click the button. This feature was introduced because it was observed that the game's timer that makes the button reappear by itself can run slow or pause all together when the window is inactive. Meaning you'd be waiting longer for the button to reappear for the script to click it again.
