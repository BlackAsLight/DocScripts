## Description

### Away Games

This script runs on the [Baseball Away Game's Page](https://politicsandwar.com/obl/play/), and refreshes the page every 3s when there are no available games until a game becomes available. When a game does get played, it will also hide the game's details so the page looks like it never happened and so you therefore, don't have to scroll.

### Home Games

This script runs on the [Baseball Home Game's Page](https://politicsandwar.com/obl/host/), and will refresh the page every 3s until you are no longer hosting a home game.
