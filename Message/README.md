# Send Message

## Description

This script runs on the [New Message Page](https://politicsandwar.com/inbox/message/) and allows you to easily and seamlessly message people by their Nation ID or Leader Name. It is not restraint by the default 21 people, in fact, it does not have a maximum number of people it can accept. It will filter out any duplicates provided in the "To" field upon hitting the Send button.

This script does require you to provide it your API Key which can be found at the bottom of the [Account's Page](https://politicsandwar.com/account/#7). To provide it with the key, when the script is installed, go to the [New Message Page](https://politicsandwar.com/inbox/message/) and at the bottom of the sidebar you'll see a button that says "Insert API Key".
