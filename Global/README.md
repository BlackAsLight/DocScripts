# aSyncly

## Description

This script allows you to sync your config settings from one browser to the next so all browsers using these scripts can share the same settings. The script will check if there is an update if it's been longer than 5mins since the last check on page load if there is less than 500 players online. If the number of players is between 500-800 then it will check every 30 mins for updates. If there is more than 800 players online then it won't check at all for updates.
