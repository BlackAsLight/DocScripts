## DO NOT

...ask me how to do this or that unless you have read, followed, and *failed* the [installation](https://docscripts.stagintin.com/#installation) instructions found on the website.

## Installation

DocScripts can be installed on many browsers and platforms. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://docscripts.stagintin.com/#installation).

## Update

On most platforms you can recevie DocScripts' updates automatically but on a few you'll need to manually update. You're also able to disable updates. You can find information about updates [here](https://docscripts.stagintin.com/#updates)

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute then you're welcome to fork this project and open a pull request. The repo is currently under a slow shift to moving the scripts to TypeScript instead of JavaScript so any new contributions will need to be done in TypeScript. You'll need Deno to convert the ts to js to test locally, but the Github Actions will end up doing the final conversion for the website version. Do make sure you update the server version in the script.
